For example, hydrochloric acid will not return a solution of hydrochloric acid but the gas itself. This could have been improved by instead searching the molecule's name on another website like Sigma Aldrich or Fischer Scientific or another site that offers chemical products, and then searching the pictograms or additional information on there. This proved to be quite tedious as it was a lot of information at specific places on the website and the method with PubChem REST API had already been finished and worked well already for a lot of compounds, so it was not replaced, but this limitation has to be kept in mind when using our <code>chemsort</code> package.</p>  \n",

A code was made for fetching the SDS pdf of a compounds on the Fisher Scientific website, which specifically has a SDS searching page and so made it possible to retrieve sections 7 and 10 on the pdf, as its format was always the same.\n",
    "Again, because of the PubChem registration of compounds, the pdf retrieved may not have been the correct one associated with the compounds, and the pdf was found with a link, which was the first link found for a compound's name, which might have also not corresponded exactly to that compounds. This could have been improved by also searching for the specific pdf of the chemical, and maybe on multiple websites and not just Fisher Scientific, but as the format of the sds pdf changes, a simple function alone would be insufficient to retrieve specific informations. Another improvement would have been to use Machine learning, but we were time-limited for this and the pictograms, acids and bases and hazards statements proved sufficient in most cases to sort hazardous chemicals.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>By inspecting the HTML code of PubChem’s website, it seemed feasible to extract safety pictogram names and hazard statements using the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package. However, this approach failed because the pictogram images are loaded dynamically via JavaScript on the compound pages, and therefore do not appear in the static HTML that BeautifulSoup parses.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To overcome this, the <code>selenium</code> package (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/selenium/\">https://pypi.org/project/selenium/</a>) was tested, as it can control a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) and scrape dynamic JavaScript-loaded content. Although Selenium worked well for retrieving information for a single compound, it proved too slow when processing multiple chemicals because it required fully loading each PubChem page in a browser, taking several minutes per compound—an unacceptable delay for large datasets.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Ultimately, the PubChem PUG-View REST API (<a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view\">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view</a>) was used instead. Initially, it was believed that this API did not contain the needed data, but after thorough analysis of its structure, the locations of the pictograms and hazard statements were successfully identified. This method was significantly faster, even when tested on a dozen compounds, and thus was kept.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Additionally, the <code>pubchempy</code> package (<a href=\"https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html\">https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html</a>) was used to retrieve each compound’s generic name, IUPAC name, and SMILES notation.</p>\n",

    "<p>The pictograms have a defined priority order; this was incorporated in the code by sorting each compound’s pictograms from highest to lowest priority before sorting the chemicals accordingly. Moreover, acids and bases were always separated due to the risk of violent reactions.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The EPFL storage categories (such as no pictograms or exclamation point, hazardous to the environment, acute toxicity, CMR/STOT, toxicity category 2/3, corrosive category 1, irritant, pyrophoric, flammable, oxidizer) become insufficient when handling chemicals with multiple hazard pictograms, especially if they include conflicting hazards.</p>\n",
