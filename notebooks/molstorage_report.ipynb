    "Chemistry students are often faced with the recurring challenge of gathering critical information about chemical compounds, such as safety data sheets (SDS), hazard pictograms, and specific properties. This process is not only tedious and time-consuming but also essential for ensuring proper handling and safety in both academic and laboratory settings. \n",

This tool also identifies and displays the different hazard categories associated with each substance.\n",
