    "<h2><b>3. Problems and Challenges</b></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4><b>Database Availability</b></h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Pictograms and safety hazard statements were not available in any existing database. Although it was possible to download databases for certain categories, such as \"corrosive\" compounds from PubChem, the corresponding hazard statements were missing or difficult to extract.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4><b>No Direct Database Access</b></h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>By inspecting the HTML code of PubChem‚Äôs website, it seemed feasible to extract safety pictogram names and hazard statements using the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package. However, this approach failed because the pictogram images are loaded dynamically via JavaScript on the compound pages, and therefore do not appear in the static HTML that BeautifulSoup parses.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To overcome this, the <code>selenium</code> package (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/selenium/\">https://pypi.org/project/selenium/</a>) was tested, as it can control a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) and scrape dynamic JavaScript-loaded content. Although Selenium worked well for retrieving information for a single compound, it proved too slow when processing multiple chemicals because it required fully loading each PubChem page in a browser, taking several minutes per compound‚Äîan unacceptable delay for large datasets.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Ultimately, the PubChem PUG-View REST API (<a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view\">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view</a>) was used instead. Initially, it was believed that this API did not contain the needed data, but after thorough analysis of its structure, the locations of the pictograms and hazard statements were successfully identified. This method was significantly faster, even when tested on a dozen compounds, and thus was adopted.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Additionally, the <code>pubchempy</code> package (<a href=\"https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html\">https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html</a>) was used to retrieve each compound‚Äôs generic name, IUPAC name, and SMILES notation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4><b>Hazardous Chemicals Sorting</b></h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The sorting of hazardous chemicals followed EPFL‚Äôs safety directives (<a href=\"https://www.epfl.ch/campus/security-safety/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chemicals-Storage-flowchart_2024.pdf\">EPFL Chemicals Storage Flowchart 2024</a>), which specify how to store chemicals based on their safety pictograms and hazard statements.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Incompatibilities between pictograms were considered according to a referenced diagram, which also recommends separating liquids from solids and storing explosive compounds or compressed gases separately, sometimes in isolation from other chemicals of the same class (e.g., oxygen storage).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The pictograms have a defined priority order; this was incorporated in the code by sorting each compound‚Äôs pictograms from highest to lowest priority before sorting the chemicals accordingly. Moreover, acids and bases were always separated due to the risk of violent reactions.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4><b>Storage Categories and Complex Cases</b></h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The EPFL storage categories (such as no pictograms or exclamation point, hazardous to the environment, acute toxicity, CMR/STOT, toxicity category 2/3, corrosive category 1, irritant, pyrophoric, flammable, oxidizer) become insufficient when handling chemicals with multiple hazard pictograms, especially if they include conflicting hazards.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For instance, triethylamine is flammable, corrosive, and acutely toxic, and as a base, it should not be stored with acids or corrosive bases due to its flammability, creating a storage conflict.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To resolve this, a new specific storage category called <b>‚Äúbase corrosive flammable‚Äù</b> was created for chemicals like triethylamine and ethanolamine. Several other custom storage categories were also developed to address similar complex cases.</p>\n",
