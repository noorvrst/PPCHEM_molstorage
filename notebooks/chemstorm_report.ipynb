A code was made for fetching the SDS pdf of a compounds on the Fisher Scientific website, which specifically has a SDS searching page and so made it possible to retrieve sections 7 and 10 on the pdf, as its format was always the same.\n",
    "Again, because of the PubChem registration of compounds, the pdf retrieved may not have been the correct one associated with the compounds, and the pdf was found with a link, which was the first link found for a compound's name, which might have also not corresponded exactly to that compounds. <p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>By inspecting the HTML code of PubChem’s website, it seemed feasible to extract safety pictogram names and hazard statements using the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package. However, this approach failed because the pictogram images are loaded dynamically via JavaScript on the compound pages, and therefore do not appear in the static HTML that BeautifulSoup parses.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To overcome this, the <code>selenium</code> package (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/selenium/\">https://pypi.org/project/selenium/</a>) was tested, as it can control a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) and scrape dynamic JavaScript-loaded content. Although Selenium worked well for retrieving information for a single compound, it proved too slow when processing multiple chemicals because it required fully loading each PubChem page in a browser, taking several minutes per compound—an unacceptable delay for large datasets.</p>\n",

    "<p>Ultimately, the PubChem PUG-View REST API (<a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view\">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view</a>) was used instead. Initially, it was believed that this API did not contain the needed data, but after thorough analysis of its structure, the locations of the pictograms and hazard statements were successfully identified. This method was significantly faster, even when tested on a dozen compounds, and thus was kept.</p>\n",

Additionally, the pictograms have a defined priority order; this was incorporated in the code by sorting each compound’s pictograms from highest to lowest priority before sorting the chemicals accordingly. Moreover, acids and bases were always separated due to the risk of violent reactions. <p> However, when following these rules, the EPFL storage categories (such as no pictograms or exclamation point, hazardous to the environment, acute toxicity, CMR/STOT, toxicity category 2/3, corrosive category 1, irritant, pyrophoric, flammable, oxidizer) become insufficient when handling chemicals with multiple hazard pictograms, especially if they include conflicting pictograms themselves.</p> <p>For example, triethylamine is flammable, corrosive, and acute toxic, and a base. It should not be stored with corrosive bases due to its flammability, creating a storage conflict. This was resolved by creating a new storage (custom storage) each time a chemical had conflicting pictograms, to make sure that no pictogram incompatibilities are present in a storage group.</p>\n",
