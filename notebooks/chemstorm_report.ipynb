    "As chemistry students, we are constantly responsible for understanding the properties and hazards of the compounds we use, particularly when it comes to storing them back safely. However, determining storage compatibility requires research and analysis that is both tedious and time-consuming, while also demanding careful focus and attention to detail. This task is essential for maintaining safe laboratory conditions, but when performed manually, it often relies on subjective judgments, and sometimes incomplete information. All of us encountered this challenge repeatedly during our first year at EPFL. In our eyes, it was a process ideal for automation.\n",

    "When entering the name of a compound on PubChem, it returns information for the compound in its pure state. This can be a problem because a lot of chemicals in the lab are in the form of already prepared solutions, and pictograms may differ between the compound in its pure and solvent form, especially at low concentration. For example, hydrochloric acid will not return a solution of hydrochloric acid, but returns the gas itself, chlorane. This could have been improved by instead searching the molecule on other websites like Sigma Aldrich or Fischer Scientific, and checking for specifications on the pictograms or additional information there. This proved to be quite tedious as it was a lot of information at specific places on the website, and the method with PubChem REST API had already been finished and worked well for a lot of compounds. Hence it was not replaced, but this limitation has to be kept in mind when using our <code>chemsort</code> package.\n",

Indeed, these may include specific storage indications, like what material the storage compartments should be made of or with which chemicals not to store the compound of interest. A code was made for fetching the SDS pdf of a compound on the Fisher Scientific website, which specifically has a SDS searching page that allowed to retrieve sections 7 and 10 from the pdf. The file allowed to extract the information and juxtapose the various statements (hazardous reactions, hazardous side product…) for two inputted compounds. However, because this information differed for each product, several complications (which will be further elaborated in section 4) were met which made it impossible to reliably integrate the function into the final code. A way of resolving this would be to implement Machine Learning, where the algorithm would be able to develop a judgment of statement relevance and priority on a large amount of SDS sheets. <br><br>\n",

    "Three main issues were encountered during the coding process: finding a database that was both complete and efficient, storing special cases of compounds with overlapping pictograms, and integrating SDS information into the final code.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding an ideal database\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;width: 95%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n",
    "Firstly, it was noted that pictograms and safety hazard statements were not available on any existing database. Although it was possible to download databases for certain categories, such as \"corrosive\" compounds from PubChem, the corresponding hazard statements were missing or difficult to extract. By inspecting the HTML code of PubChem’s website, it seemed feasible to extract safety pictogram names and hazard statements using the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package. However, this approach failed because the pictogram images are loaded dynamically via JavaScript on the compound pages, and therefore do not appear in the static HTML that BeautifulSoup parses.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To overcome this, the <code>selenium</code> package (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/selenium/\">https://pypi.org/project/selenium/</a>) was tested, as it can control a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) and scrape dynamic JavaScript-loaded content. Although Selenium worked well for retrieving information for a single compound, it proved too slow when processing multiple chemicals because it required fully loading each PubChem page in a browser, taking several minutes per compound—an unacceptable delay for large datasets.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Ultimately, the PubChem PUG-View REST API (<a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view\">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-view</a>) was used instead. Initially, it was believed that this API did not contain the needed data, but after thorough analysis of its structure, the locations of the pictograms and hazard statements were successfully identified. This method was significantly faster, even when tested on a dozen compounds, and thus was kept. Additionally, the <code>pubchempy</code> package (<a href=\"https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html\">https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html</a>) was used to retrieve each compound’s generic name, IUPAC name, and SMILES notation.\n",

    "Secondly, as we advanced in the testing of our algorithm, we noticed some cases were placed incorrectly. These consisted mainly in compounds with a larger number of pictograms, which was initially overlooked by the code.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Indeed, the pictograms are treated in a defined priority order; this was incorporated in the code by sorting each compound’s pictograms from highest to lowest priority before sorting the chemicals accordingly (function 6). Moreover, acids and bases were always separated due to the risk of violent reactions. But these EPFL storage categories (such as no pictograms, or exclamation point, hazardous to the environment, acute toxicity, CMR/STOT, toxicity category 2/3, corrosive category 1, irritant, pyrophoric, flammable, oxidizer) become insufficient when handling chemicals with multiple hazard pictograms, especially if they include conflicting hazards. For instance, triethylamine is flammable, corrosive, and acutely toxic, and as a base, it should not be stored with acids or corrosive bases due to its flammability, creating a storage conflict.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To resolve this, a new storage (custom storage) is created each time a chemical has conflicting pictograms, to make sure that no pictograms incompatibilities are present in the storage group.\n",

    "Lastly, it was found complicated to process and integrate information from the SDS sheets. Since the contained information did not follow a predefined format (like pictograms and hazard statements do) and differed for each product, it was necessary to filter each SDS individually. Initially a code was written to attempt this: while it was able to filter redundant information, eliminate errors contained within the online file and organise the remaining information into subsections, it failed to deduce clear conclusions from the comparison of this information between compounds. As mentioned, the algorithm could be developed with Machine Learning to be trained to recognise more nuanced and variable incompatibilities.\n",
